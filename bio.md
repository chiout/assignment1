My name is Tiffany. Some of my hobbies/interests include watching TV, going to karaoke with friends, and trying out new restaurants.
I really like animals, and people like to call me a cat lady for fun. I'm cool with the running joke.

Programming Background
All my programming knowledge comes from the CS 161 and CS 162 classes that I took at Oregon State. 
My CS 162 final project was definitely my favorite project to date.
The only programming language that I know right now is C++.

Future languages I would like to learn next include Java and Python. I am also excited to learn Javascript and PHP in CS 290!
