My name is Tiffany. Some of my hobbies/interests include watching TV, going to karaoke with friends, and trying out new restaurants.
I really like animals, and people like to call me a cat lady for fun. I'm cool with the running joke.

Programming Background
I am an experienced computer science expert and I design world class software for aliens interested in technology.
Just kidding, this is my alternate biography.
